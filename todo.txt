Chrome
    Getting "Suggested posts" instead of capital P - so need to detect mobile / desktop case better
    
    Doesn't seem to prompt for permissions on load even if forced to? Maybe it just gets them always?
    Publish to Chrome store


Styling bugs
    Icon looks bad in dark mode

Remove "Likes counts"
    Main feed
    Comments popup page
Remove comments counts
Remove user counts on user page
Remove rest of sidebar

Rewind / fast forward in videos


Lower priority
==============
    
Automatically reload page when settings change
    Actually just need to unhide things if hidden and setting is off now
        As it refreshes enough as you scroll and do stuff

Share options list between options.js and main.js
Make logging a debug option

Improve "Suggested Posts" hiding:
    So scrolling doesn't reach posts after a bunch of blank space
    It doesn't load the posts at all so not a performance drain.
    ??? Could record padding-top


Later features
==============

Localisation
